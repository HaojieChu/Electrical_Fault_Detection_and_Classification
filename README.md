# Electrical_Fault_Detection_and_Classification

A transmission line is a crucial component within the power system, as it is essential for transmitting electrical power from the source area to the distribution network. In our modern era, the demand for power has increased exponentially. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize any potential faults within the power system, as electrical power is essential for our daily lives. The electrical power system is made up of several intricate, dynamic, and interacting components that are always vulnerable to electrical faults or disturbances.

In order for high-capacity electrical generating power plants and the grid to remain stable. fault detection and protection equipment operation have to happen as quickly as feasible. To minimise downtime, defects on transmission lines for the electrical power system must first be accurately identified and classified. Using machine learning algorithms can help in electrical fault detection and therefore aid in avoding electrical system outages.

Various machine learning algorithms are employed in this project which are

1. Decision Tree (DT)
2. Random Forest (RF)
3. Naive Bayes (NB)
4. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The performance of each machine learning model is assessed with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 Score.

The simulation of the fault analysis is modelled by the power system and the diagram is retrieved from Kaggle. Four 11 x 10^3 V generators, one at each end of the transmission line, make up the power system. Transformers are positioned halfway along a transmission line to model and investigate different types of failures. The simulation of the circuit is performed under normal conditions and also under various fault conditions. At the power system's output side, the measured Line Voltage and Line Currents are collected. Nearly 12,000 data points are collected this way and then the data is labeled.
